I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the **McGill University**'s [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) with a minor in [**Geographical Information Science**](https://gic.geog.mcgill.ca/). Currently, I am supervised by Prof. [Renee Sieber](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/people-0/sieber) (affiliations: Prompt Chaining, RAG, OpenAI Embedding, I/O Issues, GenAI Applications), working on identifying "Weather Vulnerabilities to Past and Present Disruptive Weather" - The Continuing Challenge of Using Newspapers as Digital Data. I also have collaborations with Prof. [Luke McCaffery](https://mccaffreylab.mcgill.ca/) 's Lab at the [**Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Institute**](https://www.mcgill.ca/gci/) (engaging in **computational modeling** and **simulation** to investigate cellular dynamics and mechanisms in cancer research) and Prof. [Jacqueline Lane](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1432009)'s Group at [**Harvard Business School**](https://www.hbs.edu/) (developing advanced **GenAI frameworks** and analytical tools to optimize venture capital decisions and enhance circular economy enterprises).

I am passionate about leveraging GenAI applications and computational techniques to solve pressing issues in various topics. If you are interested in these areas or would like to chat in general, feel free to reach out to me.
